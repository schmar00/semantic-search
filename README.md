# semantic-search
Searching a CSW (Geodata catalogue) by external keyword thesaurus (SKOS/RDF). A contribution to the project GeoERA (http://geoera.eu/).
This website provides a semantic layer to search a Catalogue Webservice by keywords. This example is built to search the EGDI (Micka) (https://egdi.geology.cz/?ak=search) CSW catalogue web service. For the search logic is used the **new GeoERA Keyword Thesaurus** hosted at the Geological Survey of Austria (Sparql endpoint https://resource.geolba.ac.at/PoolParty/sparql/geoera_keyword).

## GeoERA/EGDI test link
preview https://schmar00.github.io/semantic-search/ to search in 23 browser languages (en, cs, da, el, de, es, et, fi, fr, hr, hu, is, it, lt, nl, no, pl, pt, ro, sk, sl, sv, uk). This test page doesnot work on old IE browsers. In general all modern browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Edge are supported.

# Project GeoERA (http://geoera.eu/):
The project GeoERA GIP-P WP4 initiates, designs, tests the development of vocabulary data within the framework of the GeoERA IP project, which is to support GeoERA projects. This includes suggestions for a technical infrastructure for sustainable data storage, the organization of governance and maintenance of the vocabularies, as well as the technical possibilities of coding data sets with vocabulary (e.g. within the EGDI metadata catalogue). The supported use cases are “Multilingual Semantic Text Search” and “GeoERA project vocabularies” via Linked Open Data and SKOS/RDF.
